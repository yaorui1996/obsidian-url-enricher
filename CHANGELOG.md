# Changelog

All notable changes to URL Enricher will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Fork: Favicon preview style.** A new `Favicon` option in the preview style setting (and `preview-style: favicon` frontmatter) renders the URL with the inline look — favicon, pill background, plugin font — but shows the URL text itself instead of a fetched title. The page is never requested; the only outbound call is the Google favicon service for the icon
- Release workflow now verifies the tag matches `manifest.json` and `versions.json`, has no `v` prefix, and is reachable from `master` before publishing

### Changed
- Settings loaded from disk are now validated. Out-of-range numbers are clamped, numeric strings are converted, and unrecognised values fall back to their default instead of reaching the preview renderer. Settings removed in earlier versions no longer linger in `data.json`
- Length and timeout limits come from a single set of constants, so the settings panel, frontmatter overrides, and stored settings all enforce the same bounds
- Release documentation follows the protected-branch PR workflow: the version bump lands via its own pull request and the tag is pushed only after that merge
- Removed `tsconfigRootDir` from the ESLint config; `import.meta.dirname` was flagged as an unsafe `any` assignment by Obsidian's plugin scanner

### Fixed
- The request timeout setting rejected values its own spinner allowed; both now use the same minimum
- Corrected dead documentation links in AGENTS.md and a changelog bullet split across lines in the 1.4.0 notes

## [1.4.0] - 2026-08-16

### Added
- Declarative settings API (`getSettingDefinitions()`), so plugin settings now appear in Obsidian's built-in settings search on 1.13+
- Build provenance attestation for release assets
- End-to-end decorator tests that mount a real CodeMirror editor, covering decoration precedence, staggered metadata loading, and card/inline rendering

### Changed
- **Raised `minAppVersion` to 1.13.0.** The settings tab now uses the declarative API exclusively. Users on older Obsidian versions keep receiving 1.3.2 via `versions.json` rather than breaking
- Reddit metadata is fetched from `old.reddit.com`; the original URL is still what gets cached, displayed, and opened on click
- DOM creation and timers use Obsidian's popout-window-safe APIs (`createEl`/`createDiv`/`createSpan`, `activeDocument`, `window.setTimeout`)
- Metadata refreshes are coalesced into a single repaint instead of one full-document rescan per URL
- Rebuilt the ESLint config so the `eslint-plugin-obsidianmd` preset applies correctly, and enabled `prefer-active-doc`
- Updated `obsidian` typings 1.10.0 → 1.13.1 and refreshed dependencies
- Reduced `!important` in `styles.css` from 64 to 15 and dropped rules for classes the plugin no longer renders
- Releases publish only `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` — no ZIP archive

### Fixed
- **Previews never appeared for `[text](url)` and `[[url]]` links.** Obsidian's Live Preview owns replace decorations over those ranges and loads before plugin extensions, so the plugin's decorations were discarded. They are now registered at highest precedence and render immediately instead of only after moving the caret or reopening the note
- **A link never started loading while the caret sat inside it.** The metadata fetch was skipped along with the rendering, so a just-pasted link stayed blank until the caret moved away
- **Card previews dropped the title entirely** for sites without a favicon
- **Reddit previews only ever showed "Reddit".** reddit.com serves a JavaScript bot-challenge page to non-browser clients, and its `.json` API returns 403; both subreddit and post links now resolve real titles and descriptions
- Duplicate CSS selectors, an invalid `:has(:contains())` rule that never matched anything, and an `all: unset` override
- Type-safety issues around `loadData()`, `JSON.parse`, `Map` iteration, and a regex callback
- Stale `eslint-disable` directives that no longer suppressed anything

### Removed
- The deprecated `display()` settings fallback, superseded by `getSettingDefinitions()`
- `builtin-modules` dependency, replaced with Node's built-in `node:module`

### Security
- Resolved 18 dependency vulnerabilities (3 critical, 12 high, 3 moderate), all in devDependencies

## [1.3.2] - 2025-11-11

### Added
-

### Changed
-

### Fixed

## [1.2.0] - 2025-11-08

### Added
- **Per-page color mode customization**: Frontmatter support for `inline-color-mode` and `card-color-mode` fields
  - Set color modes per-page with values: `none` (transparent) or `subtle` (theme-adaptive background)
  - Frontmatter settings override global plugin settings
  - Changes apply instantly as you type—no need to navigate away from the page
  - Example: `inline-color-mode: none` in frontmatter sets transparent background for that page's inline previews
- **Obsidian ESLint plugin integration**: Now using `eslint-plugin-obsidianmd` to automatically enforce plugin review requirements
  - Prevents `.style` assignments that violate Obsidian plugin guidelines
  - Catches violations during development before plugin review
- Added 30 new tests for frontmatter parsing and widget color mode class application (618 total tests)

### Changed
- **Upgraded to ESLint v9 with flat config format**:
  - Migrated from `.eslintrc` (ESLint v8) to `eslint.config.js` (ESLint v9)
  - Added `"type": "module"` to package.json for ES modules support
  - Configured browser globals (document, window, setTimeout, clearTimeout) for Obsidian plugin environment
  - All linting now uses the modern flat config format
- **Updated development dependencies**:
  - TypeScript 4.7.4 → 5.9.3
  - @typescript-eslint 5.29.0 → 8.46.3
  - ESLint 8.57.1 → 9.39.1
  - Added typescript-eslint v8.46.3 package
- Eliminated all JavaScript style manipulation (`.style.setProperty()` calls) to comply with plugin review bot requirements
- **Simplified color customization**:
  - Reduced color modes from 3 options (transparent/grey/custom) to 2 options (transparent/subtle background)
  - Removed custom color picker feature to eliminate JavaScript style manipulation and fix dark mode compatibility issues
  - Subtle background mode uses theme-adaptive `var(--background-modifier-border)` that works in both light and dark themes
  - Migration: Existing custom and grey color settings automatically convert to subtle background mode
  - Custom colors now available via CSS snippets (documented in README.md) for advanced users
- **Refactored color mode implementation**:
  - Changed from global body classes to widget-scoped CSS classes
  - Color mode classes now applied directly to individual preview widgets
  - Enables per-page color mode customization via frontmatter
  - Removed `updatePreviewColorCSS()` method from main plugin and settings tab
- **Documentation updates**:
  - Removed `.style.setProperty()` exception sections from AGENTS.md and CONTRIBUTING.md
  - Added clear guidance: `.style.setProperty()` has NO EXCEPTIONS (including for custom properties)
  - Documented why custom colors were removed (plugin compliance + dark mode compatibility)
  - Added real-time frontmatter updates implementation notes for contributors
  - Updated README.md with frontmatter examples including color mode fields
  - Documented ESLint plugin integration in CONTRIBUTING.md

### Fixed
- **Dark mode compatibility**: Removed hard-coded custom colors that broke readability in dark themes
- **Code quality**: Cleaned up unused imports flagged by ESLint (FetcherOptions, MetadataHandlerContext, LOG_PREFIX)

## [1.1.1] - 2025-11-08

### Added
-

### Changed
- **Code quality improvements** for Obsidian plugin review compliance:
  - Removed all console logging statements (20 total) to comply with Obsidian plugin review requirements
  - Converted Logger utility methods (error, warn, info, debug) to no-ops
  - Removed console statements from error handlers in metadata fetchers (Twitter, Reddit, Wikipedia)
  - Removed console statements from cache operations (favicon cache, HTML parser)
  - Changed developer command help() to return output instead of logging it
  

### Fixed
-

## [1.1.0] - 2025-10-30

### Added
- Obsidian plugin approval requirements to agents.md and contributing.md

### Changed
- **Code quality improvements** for Obsidian plugin review compliance:
  - Moved all inline styles to CSS classes for better maintainability and performance
  - Implemented body class approach for color mode switching (reduces JavaScript style manipulation)
  - Reduced debug logging throughout codebase (removed 17 console.log statements)
  - Improved HTML entity decoder to use manual parsing instead of browser innerHTML
- **Separate color controls** for inline and card previews:
  - Split single "Preview background color" setting into two independent settings: "Inline preview background" and "Card preview background"
  - Split single "Custom preview color" picker into two separate pickers: "Custom inline preview color" and "Custom card preview color"
  - Default: grey background for inline previews, transparent background for card previews (preserves original appearance)
  - Allows independent color customization for each preview type (e.g., grey inline + transparent cards, or different custom colors for each)
  - Migration: Existing "grey" setting automatically becomes grey inline + transparent cards; existing custom color applies to both inline and card

### Fixed
- **Security**: Replaced innerHTML usage with DOM API (createElement/textContent) in cache statistics and HTML entity decoding
- **CSS cleanup**: Added proper cleanup of color mode classes and CSS variables on plugin unload
- **Color mode defaults**: Card previews now default to transparent background instead of grey (restores original pre-1.0.2 appearance)

### Removed
- **Frontmatter color mode support** (architectural limitation):
  - Removed `preview-color-mode` frontmatter property (no longer works per-page)
  - Removed `custom-preview-color` frontmatter property (no longer works per-page)
  - Reason: Body class approach is global; per-page color modes are not possible with the current implementation
  - Color modes must now be set globally in plugin settings
  - Other frontmatter options still work per-page: `preview-style`, `max-card-length`, `max-inline-length`, `show-favicon`, `include-description`

## [1.0.1] - 2025-10-30

### Added
- more robust error and missing file handling in the version bump script
- privacy and network usage to readme
- important Obsidian resources to agents.md

### Changed
-

### Fixed
- version bump script looking in wrong place for agents.md

## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-30

  - `inline-preview.gif` - Demonstrates inline-style preview behavior
- **Updated README** with embedded demo GIFs for quick feature overview

#### Development Tools
- **.nvmrc file** - Specifies Node.js version (v18.20.5) for consistent development environment

### Changed

#### Documentation Restructure
- **Major reorganization** for improved navigation and maintainability:
  - Consolidated multi-directory structure into root-level documentation
  - Moved `AGENTS.md` to repository root for better visibility
  - Created unified `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` at root (consolidated from multiple sources)
  - Relocated `TESTING.md` to `tests/` directory alongside test files
  - Simplified `CONTRIBUTING.md` (reduced from 919 lines to focused contributor guide)
  - Enhanced `README.md` with demo GIFs, clearer structure, and improved examples
  - Updated `assets/README.md` with current asset inventory

#### Repository Cleanup
- **Removed generated artifacts**:
  - Deleted entire `coverage/` directory (HTML coverage reports now excluded from repository)
  - Removed `docs-archive/` directory (outdated documentation)
  - Cleaned up old screenshot PNGs from `assets/` (replaced with GIFs)
- **Updated .gitignore** to exclude coverage directory going forward

#### Code Cleanup

- **Import cleanup**: Updated `src/main.ts` to remove unused faviconDecorator import

### Fixed
- **Documentation**: Added known limitation about rendering links in tables to troubleshooting documentation

## [0.10.2] - 2025-10-26

### Added
-

### Changed
-

### Fixed
- **Release workflow**: Correctly resolves the previous tag for GitHub compare links (takes the next newest tag after the release tag, with repo-root fallback when no prior tag exists)

## [0.10.1] - 2025-10-26

### Added
-

### Changed
-

### Fixed
- **Release workflow**: Correctly resolves the previous tag for GitHub compare links (takes the next newest tag after the release tag, with repo-root fallback when no prior tag exists)

## [0.10.0] - 2025-10-25

### Changed

#### Length Constraint Minimums Removed

- **Previous behavior**: `max-card-length` required minimum of 100, `max-inline-length` required minimum of 50
- **New behavior**: Both settings now accept any value from 1 to 5000
- **Reason**: Users setting values like 90 were confused when they silently fell back to global defaults (300/150)
- **Recommendation**: Values of 100+ for cards and 50+ for inline are still recommended for readability
- **Impact**:
  - Settings UI now shows "Recommended: 100+" instead of hard minimums
  - Frontmatter values below old minimums (e.g., `max-card-length: 90`) are now respected
  - Documentation updated to reflect recommended ranges instead of enforced minimums
- **Migration**: No action needed - existing settings continue to work as before

#### Version Bump Script Promotes Unreleased Entries

- **Improvement**: `version-bump.mjs` now moves the `Unreleased` notes into the new version section automatically when bumping
- **Benefits**:
  - Keeps changelog tidy without manual copy/paste
  - Ensures fresh `Unreleased` template is ready for new work
- **Developer workflow**: Continue logging day-to-day changes under `## [Unreleased]`; the script handles promotion during releases

#### Developer Naming Cleanup

- **Updated**: Runtime log prefixes, favicon widget class, and package metadata now use `url-enricher` naming
- **Docs**: `CONTRIBUTING.md` setup instructions reference the renamed repository and plugin folder
- **Purpose**: Aligns developer-facing tooling with the plugin rename while keeping compatibility APIs intact


## [0.9.1] - 2025-10-25

### Added

#### Automated GitHub Release Notes

- **Added**: GitHub Actions now automatically extracts release notes from CHANGELOG.md
- **Benefit**: CHANGELOG.md is now the single source of truth for release documentation
- **Impact**: No more manual release note creation - just write good CHANGELOG entries
- **Format**: Supports both simple (0.8.0-style) and complex (0.9.0-style with nested sections) formats
- **Documentation**:
  - Enhanced `VERSION-MANAGEMENT.md` with Keep a Changelog format guidance
  - Updated `DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md` with CHANGELOG formatting examples and best practices
  - Added CHANGELOG format guidelines to `AGENTS.md` for AI agents

### Changed
-

### Fixed
-

## [0.9.0] - 2025-10-24

### Breaking Changes

#### Plugin Renamed

- **New name**: "URL Enricher" (was "Inline Link Preview")
- **Plugin ID changed**: `url-enricher` from `obsidian-inline-link-preview`
- **Reason**: Better reflects the non-destructive enrichment functionality

#### Display Mode Removed

- All previews (both Card and Inline styles) now always flow inline with text
- No more automatic line breaks or spacing above previews
- **Removed setting**: "Display mode" (inline/block option)
- **Removed frontmatter**: `preview-display` property
- **User control**: Press Enter manually to create line breaks if desired
- **Benefit**: Eliminates unwanted spacing, simplifies UX

#### Terminology: "Bubble" → "Inline"

- **Preview style**: "bubble" renamed to "inline" for clarity
- **Settings**:
    - `maxBubbleLength` → `maxInlineLength`
    - UI text: "Maximum bubble length" → "Maximum inline length"
- **Frontmatter**:
    - `preview-style: bubble` → `preview-style: inline`
    - `max-bubble-length` → `max-inline-length`
- **TypeScript**: `PreviewStyle` type values changed
- **CSS classes**: All `.inline-url-preview-*` → `.url-preview-*`

#### CSS Class Rationalization

- **Base class**: `.inline-url-preview` → `.url-preview`
- **Style modifiers**:
    - `.inline-url-preview--bubble` → `.url-preview--inline`
    - `.inline-url-preview--card` → `.url-preview--card`
- **Element classes**: All `.inline-url-preview__*` → `.url-preview__*`
- **Utility classes**: All `.ilp-*` → `.url-preview-*`
- **Removed classes**: `.inline-url-preview--bubble-inline`, `.inline-url-preview--bubble-block` (no longer needed)
- **Impact**: Custom CSS targeting old classes will need updates

### Migration Guide

#### For Users

**Settings Migration (Automatic)**:

- `maxBubbleLength` automatically becomes `maxInlineLength` on plugin load
- `displayMode` setting automatically removed
- No user action required

**Frontmatter Updates (Optional)**:

- Update `preview-style: bubble` → `preview-style: inline` in notes
- Update `max-bubble-length` → `max-inline-length` in notes
- Remove `preview-display` property from notes
- Old properties are silently ignored (no errors)

**Display Changes**:

- If you used `preview-display: block` for spacing, manually press Enter before/after URLs
- Cards and inline previews both flow inline - no automatic spacing

#### For Custom CSS Users

Update any custom CSS targeting plugin classes:

```css
/* Old */
.inline-url-preview { }
.inline-url-preview--bubble { }
.inline-url-preview--card { }

/* New */
.url-preview { }
.url-preview--inline { }
.url-preview--card { }
```

#### For Developers

- Developer API now available at `window.urlEnricher` (also `window.inlineLinkPreview` for compatibility)
- All log messages now prefixed with `[url-enricher]` instead of `[inline-link-preview]`

### Benefits

- **Clearer terminology**: "Inline" better describes the compact preview style
- **No unwanted spacing**: Previews flow naturally with text
- **Shorter CSS classes**: Cleaner, more maintainable styles
- **Simplified codebase**: Removed unnecessary display mode logic

### Bug Fixes

#### Hashtag and Mention Styling Now Works

- **Fixed**: CSS class name mismatch prevented hashtags (#tag) and mentions (@user) from being styled
- **Changed**: Class names from `ilp-hashtag`/`ilp-mention` to `url-preview-hashtag`/`url-preview-mention`
- **Impact**: Hashtags and mentions now display with accent color and bold weight in all previews

#### Empty Link Text Support

- **Fixed**: Empty markdown links `[](https://example.com)` were completely ignored
- **Changed**: Updated regex to allow zero-length link text
- **Impact**: `[](url)` now works like a bare URL, displaying fetched page title

#### Titles Now Support Hashtag/Mention Styling

- **Fixed**: Hashtags and mentions were only styled in descriptions, not titles
- **Changed**: All titles (card mode, inline mode, Reddit posts) now use `enrichTextWithStyledElements()`
- **Impact**: Hashtags and mentions stand out in titles as well as descriptions

#### Title truncation

- Titles now respect max length settings. Previously, very long titles (e.g., from Instagram) bypassed truncation and exceeded configured limits. Both title and description are now intelligently truncated to fit within the maximum length:
    - If title alone exceeds max length → title is truncated, description removed
    - If title + description exceed max length → both are truncated intelligently
    - Titles are preserved up to the limit; descriptions are truncated or removed as needed
    - Title truncation priority: When content exceeds max length, titles are always preserved (truncated if needed), and descriptions are added only if space permits.

### Enhancements

#### Custom Link Text Behavior Improved

- **Changed**: Markdown links with custom text now display fetched page title instead of custom text
- **Previous**: `[my custom text](https://reddit.com/...)` showed "my custom text" as title
- **New**: Always shows actual page title from metadata for consistency
- **Fallback**: Custom text used only when page metadata unavailable
- **Benefit**: Ensures title, description, favicon, and site name all match actual page content
- **Note**: Custom link text still visible in source mode

#### LinkedIn Title Cleaning

- **Added**: New LinkedIn metadata handler for cleaner, more readable titles
- **Problem**: LinkedIn titles start with hashtags: `#tag1 #tag2 | Author | 17 comments — Content`
- **Solution**: Automatically cleans to: `Author — Content`
- **Features**:
    - Removes leading hashtag blocks
    - Removes comment counts ("17 comments", "1 comment")
    - Preserves hashtags that appear naturally in content
    - Extracts author name and content preview
    - Works with posts, articles, company pages, and profiles
- **Example**:
    - Before: `#personalbranding #careerbranding | Hina Arora | 17 comments — We are using the ChatGPT...`
    - After: `Hina Arora — We are using the ChatGPT...`

#### Frontmatter-only activation mode

- New "Require frontmatter to activate" setting allows opt-in per page. When enabled, the plugin only shows previews on pages with frontmatter properties. This is useful for users who only want previews in specific notes (e.g., research, bookmarks) rather than across their entire vault.

## [0.7.0] - 2025-10-17

### Added

- **Site name footer in cards** - Cards now display the site name (e.g., "WIKIPEDIA", "OPENAI", "REDDIT") at the bottom with a subtle top border separator
- **Metadata-based site names** - Extracts site names from `og:site_name` or `application-name` meta tags for accurate branding
- **Fallback site name extraction** - If metadata doesn't provide site name, extracts from URL hostname (e.g., "anthropic.com" → "ANTHROPIC")
- **Wikipedia site name override** - Wikipedia pages now show "WIKIPEDIA" instead of language codes (e.g., "EN", "ES")
- DOMParser extraction for `og:site_name` and `application-name` meta tags
- Regex parser fallback for site name extraction

### Changed

- **Refined card design** - Cleaner, more polished appearance:
    - Increased padding: `1em 1.25em` (was `0.875em 1em`)
    - Larger border radius: `10px` (was `8px`)
    - More subtle shadows for cleaner look
    - Better hover effects with `-2px` lift
- **Better typography**:
    - Title slightly larger: `1.05em` with improved letter-spacing `-0.015em`
    - Description more readable: `0.94em` with `line-height: 1.6` and `opacity: 0.95`
- **Smaller favicons** - Reduced from `2em` to `1.75em` for better proportions
- **Improved spacing** - More breathing room between all card elements
- **Refined footer** - Site name footer styling:
    - Smaller text: `0.68em` with `font-weight: 500`
    - Lower opacity: `0.45` for less visual competition
    - More letter-spacing: `0.1em` for cleaner uppercase
    - Top border separator for clear visual boundary
    - More spacing: `margin-top: 0.9em` with `padding-top: 0.8em`

### Fixed

- Wikipedia pages now correctly show "WIKIPEDIA" as site name instead of language code ("EN")

## [0.5.0] - Unreleased

### Breaking Changes

- **Removed all conversion/paste functionality** - The plugin is now 100% non-destructive
- **Removed favicon decorator** - No longer adds favicons to `[text](url)` markdown links (only decorates bare URLs)
- **Removed URL display mode setting** - URL display is now automatic: cards show small editable URLs below the card, bubbles hide URLs entirely
- **Card layout change** - URLs now appear below the card preview as editable text, not inside the card footer
- Removed "Convert links on paste" setting
- Removed command palette commands:
    - "Convert selection to inline preview"
    - "Convert existing links to inline previews…"
- Changed default `dynamicPreviewMode` from `false` to `true`

### Added

- **Card-style previews** - New "card" style option for more prominent, detailed previews with Material Design principles
- **Material Design aesthetics** - Cards use elevation shadows, smooth transitions, and clean typography
- **Enhanced Reddit post previews**:
    - Bubble: Shows `r/Subreddit — Post Title` (subreddit first)
    - Card: Subreddit beside favicon, post title below, content preview beneath
    - Separate description lengths: 200 chars for cards, 100 chars for bubbles
- **Card header layout** - Favicon and title displayed side-by-side in a flex row
- **Wikipedia support** - New Wikipedia metadata handler extracts 3-sentence article descriptions via Wikipedia API
- **High-resolution favicons** - Requests 128px icons from Google for crisp display on retina screens and in cards
- **Flexible display modes**:
    - "Inline" - Previews flow with surrounding text, can wrap across multiple lines
    - "Block" - Previews appear on their own line (default)
- **Per-page configuration** via frontmatter:
    - `preview-style: card` or `preview-style: bubble`
    - `preview-display: inline` or `preview-display: block`
- New settings in UI:
    - Preview style dropdown (bubble/card)
    - Display mode dropdown (inline/block)
- Card-specific CSS styling with hover effects, larger favicons, and better visual hierarchy

### Changed

- Renamed internal `displayMode` parameter to `urlDisplayMode` for clarity
- Updated all documentation to reflect non-destructive-only approach
- Reorganized settings UI into logical sections:
    - Core Settings
    - Preview Appearance
    - Preview Content
    - Cache Management
- Improved settings descriptions and help text
- Plugin now defaults to being enabled (dynamicPreviewMode: true)
- Bubble previews now use `display: inline` for inline mode, allowing natural text wrapping
- Cards use `display: inline-block` for inline mode, allowing text flow but preventing mid-card wrapping

### Fixed

- Cursor-aware previews now work correctly in all scenarios
- Preview rendering performance improved for large documents
